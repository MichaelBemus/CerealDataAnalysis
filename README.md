# CerealDataAnalysis
Creating a basic statistical report and visualization plot to summarize the consumer data of 77 different cereals using the Pandas and MatPlotLib Python libraries.

Included in this repository are 4 files:
 * cereal.csv - The small data set used for this analysis.
 * cereal_analysis.py - The code used to create our data reports.
 * cereal_out.txt - A list of basic sample statistics and max-value observations based on our data.
 * cereal_out.png - Three plots used to visualize the distributions of our data and compare the cereals of different manufacturers.

This project was designed to conduct exploratory analysis of the cereal data. We aimed to identify points of interest in the data set which could be leveraged to inspire future research.
